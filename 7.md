# Track payment status

As soon as the payment is over, send us the notification on the status of the payment. These responses are crucial in order to track transaction success/failure metrics. For instance:

```
GodelTracker.getInstance().trackPaymentStatus(:transactionId,
        GodelTracker.PaymentStatus.SUCCESS);
```


Payment status can be one of: ***SUCCESS***, ***FAILURE*** or ***CANCELLED***.

## POSTing from Server

If there is any difficulty in making this call from the client, you can also `POST` this information to our servers directly using the following call. We would recommend that you `POST` from server also even if you are calling the method on `GodelTracker` in the client.

    POST https://logs.juspay.in/godel/analytics

    HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"data":[{"merchant_id": "your_merchant_id",
        "client_id": "your_client_id",
        "order_id": "ORD141231112205308",
        "transaction_id": "ORD141231112205308",
        "payment_status": "SUCCESS"}]
        }

* In the above, we recommend that you send both `order_id` and `transaction_id` if you are initializing the fragment with these. However, one of them would suffice as long as uniqueness can be achieved.
* `payment_status` can be one of: ***SUCCESS***, ***FAILURE*** or ***CANCELLED***.

As we have already mentioned, we rely greatly on the status metrics to fine tune our system (both currently deployed and future versions as well). Failure to send status metrics might result in us **disabling the enhancements** for your customers.
