# Track payment status

As soon as the payment is over, send us the notification on the status of the payment. These responses are crucial in order to track transaction success/failure metrics. For instance:

```
GodelTracker.getInstance().trackPaymentStatus(:transactionId,
        GodelTracker.PaymentStatus.SUCCESS);
```

Payment status can be one of: ***SUCCESS***, ***FAILURE*** or ***CANCELLED***.

## POSTing from Server

To minimize chances of missing payment status, we would recommend you to `POST` this information to our servers directly using the following call. This could be in addition to the call on `GodelTracker` in the client.

    POST https://logs.juspay.in/godel/analytics

    HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"data":[{"merchant_id": "your_merchant_id",
        "client_id": "your_client_id",
        "order_id": "ORD141231112205308",
        "transaction_id": "ORD141231112205308",
        "payment_status": "SUCCESS"}]
        }

* In the above, we recommend that you send both `order_id` and `transaction_id` if you are initializing the fragment with these. However, one of them would suffice as long as uniqueness is achieved.

We rely greatly on the payment status metrics to fine tune our system (both current and future versions). Failure to send status metrics might result in us **disabling the enhancements** for your customers.
