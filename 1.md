#Getting Started

Godel can be added as a Fragment in your activity. It is a replacement for your current webview to process payments. The webview will be augmented with an assistance frame which will directly interact with the page.

Kindly go through the document and pay close attention to the **Parameters Chapter (3.2)**, it contains some key value pairs for the initialization bundle. 
 
Before creating the release build, review the **Merchant Checklist (Chapter 11)** and whitelist Godel Library as given in **Proguard Rules (Chapter 10)**.
