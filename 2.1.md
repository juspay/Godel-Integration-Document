## Gradle

Add the following maven repository to the build.gradle. Please make sure that you add it in the project dependency section and NOT the buildScript section.

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
       url "https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/godel-release/godel/"
    }
}
```

Add the following compile dependency to your project. Once again make sure you donâ€™t accidentally add it to script dependencies.

In the latest Godel version, we are supporting a wide variety of minSdk-targetSdk versions as part of the build. The final version number is a concatenation of base number and minSdk-targetSdk.

Current base version being 0.6.19, the final library version is in the format of 0.6.19.xxxx.

|Version Number|minSdk|targetSdk|
|--------------|------|---------|
|0.6.19.1421|14|21|
|0.6.19.1423|14|23|


```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:+'
    compile 'in.juspay:godel:0.6.19.1423'
}
```
