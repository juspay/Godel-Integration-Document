## Gradle

Add the following maven repository to the build.gradle. Please make sure that you add it in the project dependency section and NOT the buildScript section.

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven {
       url "https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/godel-release/godel/"
    }
}
```

Add the following compile dependency to your project. Once again make sure you donâ€™t accidentally add it to script dependencies.

```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:+'
    compile 'in.juspay:godel:0.6.4'
}
```
