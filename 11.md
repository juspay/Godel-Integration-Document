# Merchant Checklist

Please ensure that the following items are checked off before release to have a cleaner integration:

1. The AndroidManifest.xml entry for the activity should say android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize".

2. The activity holding the Juspay Fragment should fix the orientation as **portrait**.

3. Ensure that correct value is sent for **merchantId** and **clientId** to identify the Merchant.

4. Send a unique **orderId** or **transactionId** to cross-check data with Juspay.

5. 
4. At the end of the flow, payment status is being tracked using the call GodelTracker.trackPaymentStatus
5. All the classes under in.juspay.godel namespace should be kept out of ProGuard optimization.
