# Ten-Point Merchant Checklist

Please ensure that the following items are checked off before release to have a cleaner integration:

1. The AndroidManifest.xml entry for the activity should say android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize".

2. The activity holding the Juspay Fragment should fix the orientation as **portrait**.

3. Ensure Android **permissions** are updated to include:
"android.permission.INTERNET"; 
"android.permission.READ_SMS";
"android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS";
"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"

4. Ensure that correct value is sent for **merchantId** and **clientId** to identify the Merchant.

5. Send a unique **orderId** or **transactionId** to cross-check data with Juspay.

6. Send **payment_status** via GodelTracker.trackPaymentStatus or `POST` this information to our servers directly. We would recommend server side payment_status as it is 100% reliable.

7. Other useful parameters are - 'card_brand', 'card_type', transaction 'amount' for invoicing, 'customerId' or 'customerEmail' for user-level analytics.

8. **Back button integration** in Chapter 8 is crucial to provide contextual help and unblockers on bank pages.

9. All the classes under in.juspay.godel namespace should be kept out of **ProGuard** optimization.

10. Get the final build tested by Juspay's QA team to check functionality of Godel features.
