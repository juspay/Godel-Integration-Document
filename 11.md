# Merchant Checklist

Please ensure that the following items are checked off before release to have a cleaner integration:

1. The AndroidManifest.xml entry for the activity should say android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize".

2. The activity holding the Juspay Fragment should fix the orientation as **portrait**.

3. Ensure that correct value is sent for **merchantId** and **clientId** to identify the Merchant.

4. Send a unique **orderId** or **transactionId** to cross-check data with Juspay.

5. Send **payment_status** via GodelTracker.trackPaymentStatus or `POST` this information to our servers directly. We would recommend server side payment_status as it is 100% reliable.

6. **Back button integration** in Chapter 8 is crucial to provide contextual help and unblockers on bank pages.

7. All the classes under in.juspay.godel namespace should be kept out of **ProGuard** optimization.
