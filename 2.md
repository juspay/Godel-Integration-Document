# Getting the SDK

The library can be added as a direct dependency when you use Gradle. If you donâ€™t use Gradle, we provide a downloadable SDK which you can add as a project dependency.

Before you initialize the Browser SDK, please call the following function from your Checkout Activity: 
```
JuspayBrowserFragment.openJuspayConnection();
```
