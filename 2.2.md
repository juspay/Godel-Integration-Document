## Non Gradle (or Eclipse style integration)

Download the binary from this location:

This can be added directly as a project dependency in Eclipse or Intellij Idea. Besides adding  the project as a dependency, you will have to add to the assets too. Once the library is extracted into a folder, navigate to ***godel/assets***. Add everything in the folder to your ***src/main/assets*** folder.

```
cp $GODEL_LIBRARY_PATH/assets/* $PROJECT_HOME/src/main/assets
```

You should add appcompat-v4 from Google SDK as a library project as well.
